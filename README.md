************Old concept**************

concept_0.5
This concept was to use a loop_feedback so that it directly takes any audio being played in the computer. This was then supposed to be made as a browser extension, but i didn't have sufficient time to complete it before my final year project dateline

concept_1.0
This concept uses a mic to take audio from the computer's speaker. Didn't worked well. Lots of noise which results in misclassification.
